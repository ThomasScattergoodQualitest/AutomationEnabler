Absolutely disgusting with the treatment I received in the cex shop in Cavan Ireland. Bought a phone here with disabled shortly after purchase. Brought it back to be rudely told they couldn’t do anything that I’d have to bring it to repair shop.did so and man in repair shop told me it was faulty and bring it back to cex and don’t let them fob you off. Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me. This shop needs highlighting and should not be allowed rip people off like they do. I say shut them down.

Only I can’t give it a zero review I bloody well would!!!! I bought a phone in my local CEX store on the 2/12/21 the phone hadnt been working from I got it the speaker was not working right probably down to the fact the day I got it the lad serving me dropped it on the counter so I took back today they told me to leave with them for 40 mins to check it over then I go back in only to be told £72 voucher exchange or £57 cash absolute bloody joke I paid £155 for the phone so I’m out £98 and I cannot afford to buy a new phone now until way after Xmas stay clear of this shop if you don’t want robbed or fobbed off!!!!!!!!

I have given them a 1 star but they deserve a minus 10 never in my life have i ever recieved such service such utter twaddle in my life ! 43 years on this earth and I thought I had heard it all . I purchased a 3ds from the store in cramlington it was easy she got it out I selected a few games she put it in a box and went and got the charger put it in and i paid HAPPY !! Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.

I have bought a second hand I phone with giving my old phone and added the difference, the stuff was a bit overwhelmed so It took me ages to verify everything and log out to my account ... but the phone still work and it is in a good condition for a good price

Zoie and Kieran at cex in Milton Keynes made such an effect for me and served me with a smile and patience, I was selling my Xbox series x and they went above and beyond to attend to my needs, bank transfer wasn't good for me and there wasn't much money left in their tills, they still went and checked all the tills to collect the money I needed.
will defiantly recommend this store, great customer service.

I sold in two iPhones because I’m struggling for money, they claimed that the phones where damaged, I had photos of the phones before shipping them to CeX. CeX sent the phones back to me damaged, I made a complaint and they filed a claim with Royal Mail and told me I had to wait 30 days (CeX paid postage so they were legally responsible for what happened to my goods) so I waited and then I get this short email back basically saying they had an outcome with Royal Mail (which means they got paid compensation for my iPhone which they already shipped back to me) instead of giving me the compensation they told me that they will buy the damage phone, so they pocket the compensation of £85 and give me £34.99 so they are pocketing the compensation, trying to give me less and will get the phone fixed and sell it. They are very dishonest and try to scam disabled people like me

A 3 star purely on the amount if dirt and yellow stains in every game I have bought, covered in stickers as well, why can't you clean your games ?

Really bad place to shop, the phone I bought became faulty after 8 days and they claimed the fault was caused by me. They have been extremely rude and did not check the phone at all. They offer you guarantee but they will find every excuse not to honor this guarantee. And don't try even to take it with customer service as there is almost non. You can't phone or email them, only fill some online form which does not help as the person who replies is taking immediately the side of the shop without providing any kind of proof to the claims made by the Cex shop manager.
Stay away they don't deserve even the one star, If I could give zero stars I would but unfortunately one star is the lowest grade

Took laptop in last Wednesday did not receive cash. Went back in to the shop as could not contact by phone, they had not uploaded my bank details said they had done it now it is Monday afternoon still not received payment left 2 emails asking them to call me no one has called me still appalling service

Bought a oculus rift s a year ago, took it back under warranty after a technical fault with the head set to be told its void because there is a crack in the hand control.
The staff in particular sam (the store manager apparently) in Guildford branch actually laughed in our face and then slammed the laptop shut and said I refuse you service! Disgusting, left a heart broken 10yr old boy. NEVER will I enter a Cex store ever again.

Product I bought (£525 graphics card) arrived damaged and broken.
Contacted immediately upon delivery and showed images. They come back with “sorry it didn’t leave us like it. We cannot help any more”.
Unbelievably poor. Steer clear.

Just never recieved my order. Contacted them about it, it was delivered to a post office miles from me and I was told to collect it and its tough. You have to pay for delivery too, so just dont use them.

They have very very bad customer service. They sell faulty goods and state that their warranty does not cover 'customer damage' when in fact the goods they sell are already faulty.
bought some ear pods 27 September 2021 for £60. took them back 3 weeks later and told them left ear bud not working. They did their 'diagnostic' which lasted 10 minutes. They then told me it is working fine. Continued to have problems and took them back (twice within 2 months of purchase).
They then tell me pin is damaged and that their warranty does not cover customer damage. I told them that I hardly used the buds. They were not interested!!!!!
never buy anything from these crooks. Spoke to someone who worked for them. He said they buy items off of people and just put them on display without checking properly.

Only they want is your money nothing else

So called warranty was voided because screw was missing when they checked it But it was there when it was securely posted Won’t be using this company again

Workers are useless haven't got a clue and con you got a silly girl who took the Wii console and said she couldn't take the controller gave a receipt to get the money but when I went back was told they couldn't take it as there's no controllers maybe get workers who know what they are doing and talking about. Absolutely shocking workforce

Hi Simon,

Thank you for your patience.

I have checked with the store and it seems that due to some mixup the AMD Radeon RX 580 was sent to an incorrect address and the other customer's order was sent to your address. I apologise for the inconvenience caused to you.
Feedback has been given to the store that fulfilled the order so that going forward no such instances happen.

Would never buy from cex again. Bought a Samsung tablet in May 2021 with a 24month warrenty, 5months after buying it the screen has got lines on it, taken it back to the Portsmouth branch where we bought it, to be told it has been dropped, we have not dropped it and looking on you tube it is a common problem that a wire has come loose, but have been told we have to pay £60 to get it repaired.
Not only have we been called liars but we have to pay to get it repaired. Totally disguised with the customer service, and the warrenty isn't worth the paper it is printed on.

So I brought a mac book air from cex it had taken me just under 8 months to save up for a second hand laptop. I have had the laptop for less then 4 months and now it has a charging fault. I took it back and now they are saying it damaged. I am so disappointed.i have used my laptop about 4 times over the sapce of 4 months and its always kept save and locked away where no one has acess. I had brought the laptop with some damages on it I am so stupid I should of taken pictures on arrival. I am trying me best to get this resolved I just can't afford to loose £300 it's left me so heartbroken and I just can't believe it. What's the worst thing I always go to this cex for my kids games and just browse and I always say hello to all staff.

DO NOT buy pokemon gameboy games from this company. Two i've had have been fake & three have had no batteries in them. The store where i bought them wouldn't even replace a dead/dry battery but are happy enough to sell you it when you can't save your game. What do they actually test?? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!

Took my Fitbit versa in to sell to them- really great condition and they offered me £27.....fair enough so left it there to be tested came back after an hour to be told it was reported lost/ stolen.....U have a receipt from Amazon for it - bought it new in December 2019 so what the hell? I resent being labelled a thief especially in CEX which clearly does buy stuff from dodgy people! I have complained to Head Office and am now selling it elsewhere on line. Waste of time dealing with them.

Pray on the desperate and sell xbox series x for 200 quid more than an original.
Profiteering and should be illegal what they do.
Terrible company, with equally terrible moral trading standards.
Don't touch with a barge pole. Also known to fence stolen goods, which shoplifters steal and takenand sell to them.
Avoid like the plague. Zero stars.

They knowingly sent out a charger that did not fit the watch. Refused any partial refund for the wrong charger.

Absolutely outrageous. My 7 year old daughter change her mind about 2 xbox360 games (£14) we have purchased. She has not even played them.
Came to store 4 days later to get a full refund obviously. Guess what? They have 2 days policy!!!!!! 2days!!!! I felt like I am trying to return out of date smelly fish!
I've been offered £5 for both games, because they CAN BUY IT from me!
I've never felt so ripped-off in my life.

Purchased a Nintendo DS for my partner from CEX in KILMARNOCK, after playing she complained that there was a part missing and it wasn’t charging properly. Having only bought it the previous day took it back to the shop with receipt for my money back only to discover that it MUST be put through a “warranty test” to justify my return. After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX). I wouldn’t recommend this mob as they falsely advertise their warranty and aren’t willing to budge even with the phrase “the customers always right”. AVOID like the plague of zombies that pollute Kilmarnock burns mall. These jokers are rip off merchants.

Bought a used laptop from Crystal Peaks Sheffield. The 2 year warranty was attractive and I mistakenly trusted they would be decent and honest to deal with. It failed after a few months but CEX would not honour the guarantee. I accept the laptop was bought as 2nd class because of previous owner mishandling but if CEX want to play that game ,don't pretend it has a warranty. Very disappointed with CEX and would advise against using them.

Brought a iPhone SE within a week the screen developed a fault and then went off completely. Took back into store and said about it asked for instore voucher so I could get a replacement and they came back saying I have damaged the scree it’s not covered on the 24 month warranty as it’s classed as accidental damage.. so wasted £360 and a useless phone and CEX staff it’s my fault and should be more careful.
CEX warranty is a complete joke and staff are rude.

Please do not buy from cex. I went to get a Xbox one controller to find out it's cheaper to buy them brand new. When to return the item to be told i camt have my no at back only in store credit. RIP OFF

Went back to the shop a day later bt would nt give me a refund coz theysaid therewasbt anythi g wrong with game even after i explai ed it wasnt what i was looking for. They gave me an in store voucher i stead bt that meant i cant use that money to buy game in another shop. My money is nw locked in their shop so nw i have no choice but come back to cex. Any other shop would have given a refund to card used when making the purchase. I do nt recommend buying from Cex.

Not sure about all the bad reviews on here, never had any issues with my local store and any issues i've run into online (had a couple, been sent the wrong google nest/home model, dirty items) have been quickly dealt with. I suggest contacting CEX through facebook messenger, usually get a reply the same day. Been refunded for items in full quickly and easy when faults have arose, sold to cex in store too and had no issues again.

Frankly I am fed-up with getting damaged DVD's from CEX. Angry with myself just bought another box set, needless to say it's badly damaged. Clearly there quality control is simply just poor.
As for their customer service I concur with other reviewers the best adjective is: terrible. That said I notice they monitor sites like this to leave a: just contact us; let us help: really!
I am attempting to cancel a DVD box set I ordered, once done will be terminating my account. Amazon is where I will buy from.
So angry with myself for buying from them again.
Buy DVD/DVD box set; settle down to watch. The the endless frustration of a damaged DVD. Well this was the last time.

Ordered a laptop from them 20th July 2021. Item was never delivered. I was refused a refund and made to wait until 3rd August as they could not be bothered to chase the order with Royal Mail.
It is now 3rd August, still no laptop, no update, no response to email and no refund.
This company is genuinely not worth dealing with. Customer service is very very poor. There are other sites selling similar products that I will be going to now.
Update 4th August 2021.
After contact from CeX this morning (after this review, no surpise!) they still clearly have not looked into the countless emails I have sent over the last two weeks. Still no meaningful response, no refund and no accountability for their error as they are trying to blame Royal Mail who they subcontract out to so ultimately the responsibility lies with CeX.

I purchased a limited collectors edition box set on Blu-ray which was in a steelbook “breaking bad” what they send me was the regular edition. The limited edition they charged me £22 for, they sent me the £15 regular edition and rather than refund me the difference they insisted I travel an hour away to the post office to return it which would cost me more in travel costs than it’s worth. They don’t care how they treat customers.

Avoid, avoid, avoid. Customer service is simply pathetic in this place. I bought ps4 not long time ago and I asked person who sold me it (Killian) 3 TIMES!!!! is the 24 warranty cover everything including controller. He said yes 3 times. I came back to cex tallagh in Thursday in my only day off to get it fixed with no charging issue and girl told me that my pad is covered only 6 months as policy change during lockdown!!!! I ask for a manager and he said the same looking straight into my eyes!!!! When I went online for complain they told me that the pad IS covered by 2 years and I need to come back with a pad. Told them that I'm not going there as it's a waste of time and I dont drive so I was informed to send someone else or go to different cex in Ireland!!! Becaaue of your fault I need to involve 3rd people into this or go to city centre!!!! Its a joke!!!! Its already week that my issue is not sorted and I'm week without a pad. Lady in customer service keep telling me that I have to go to bring the old pad as otherwise i dont get new one. Really??? Pad cost you about 30 euro and your sales person lie to me about it. They offer me 10 euro to cover my time waste..... 10 euro... that's what a customer is worth for them. I just ask to ship new pad to my home as I already spend nearly 2 hours walking to them and they lie to me by telling shorter period of warranty even talking with manager. Be aware of this company as everything what they are telling could be a lie and small things like pad replacement it's a nightmare for them. I had to contact my solicitor as I can not leave it like that right now.

Rip off merchants. Took my iPhone 11 in to attempt to sell in Worcester . In good condition they looked it over and said it’s a C Grade!! Offered me £110. I told them to shove it. When I took it into apple they said it’s a B grade . They gave me £400 for it towards a new phone. I’ll never sell here again or buy anything CEX membership has now been thrown a way in the trash just like your stores . Sell your items privately don’t use CEX their robbing you of your money

BEWARE IF BUYING A LAPTOP!!
Q: When is a laptop sealed battery not a sealed battery? A: When you try to get it repaired under the CeX warranty.
Had laptop for 8 months, hardly used yet battery is completely dead. Checked CeX warranty and despite it clearly stating it covers sealed batteries, the staff in Edinburgh's Rose Street branch say differently because it can be unclipped and is therefore a consumable! Absolute disgrace, bunch of con artists, well done on losing any future custom from us The warranty isn't worth the paper it's printed on AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!

I ordered an Ipad from here. Cex has sent me a completely different Ipad that is not part of the company. When I went the the Cex store for a refund they said I received the wrong Ipad and didn't help me at all to get a refund despite Cex sending me the wrong one, the staff are horrible. None of the staff helped me with anything even though they made this mistake. Never had such a bad experience before. Will never buy from here again, terrible staff. Store manager is horrible as well and didn't try to help me at all. I contacted customer service but they kept saying that they didn't send me the wrong Ipad despite me having proof that I received a different Ipad from the one I ordered. I do not recommend anyone to buy from here, they are a scam.

Purchased an iPhone online about 10 months ago and speakers have suddenly gone. As it had 2 year guarantee I took it back to my local town store Nottingham exchange walk, expected to have a battle as you do with any faulty goods these days but was pleasantly suprised. They tested the phone found the fault and refunded me - still waiting for the payment to clear as was done on a Sunday but the staff were all helpful and polite nothing was an issue and they didn't have a problem checking out what I'd said. So Happy with the service i purchased another phone at the same time whilst waiting for the money to clear! I would recommend and id certainly buy from them again, got the service I always wished every one gave! Thank you!

I bought some Powerbeats in May (Grade B). came in a filthy box and were broken. I couldn’t take back to the store for 2 week due to work but made them aware as soon as the product arrived. I had to travel to a store to return the item and pick up a replacement which had been arranged following my initial Trust Pilot review.
I took them back to the store who could see that they clearly shouldn’t have been dispatched in the condition they were in. The store manager showed me the replacement and embarrassingly informed me the replacement was damaged as well. I was fuming and had no option for a refund.
I made a complaint and Kester was liasing with me. He offered a good will gesture of £10. He then asked me to change my initial review!!!! I didn’t of course and then once the money had been refunded I look to but the Powerbeats again only to see they had increased the price for the same Grade by at least £10. This meant that the £10 voucher was basically non existent! I complained about this and was told I should have purchased the other Powerbeats immediately!!
I replied stating I did and the replacement you ordered for me to collect in the store was again faulty so I left it 2 weeks before deciding to try again!!
Don’t bother buying anything as if everything is correct CeX are great but appalling when things go wrong. The customer service has been none existent. You can’t even speak to anyone and have to do everything by email!
”“
Do not order from this company online. They take payment and only let you know that the item is not in stock if you contact them first. Your refund might be returned eventually if you are lucky. Whatever about the stores, save yourself alot of hassle and try another company online. Personally I would give minus stars as a review.
