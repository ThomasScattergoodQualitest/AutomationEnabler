I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX).

A week or so later, the first game arrived in a very thin parcel which definitely only contained 1 game as there would not have been room for any more. I did not think this was unusual, as their own website stated that games may be dispatched separately as they may come from different stores. However, after a few more weeks when the second game did not arrive, I chased it with CEX (something I was only able to do via their website/email as they have no customer service telephone number to speak of). Initially a handler named Doris responded very helpfully that she would chase this up with the store responsible for dispatching the games, however, the subsequent emails quickly turned accusatory with phrases like As you claim you haven't received one game and the store has confirmed that both the items were sent in the same parcel.\\nThe handler seemed fixated on the condition of the original packaging that the first game came in, which i confirmed i had since thrown away as i expected the 2nd game to follow separately but was in perfectly fine condition. The handler was also extremely reluctant to escalate this to a manager, instead attempting to pacify me by stating she would pass it to the central team to investigate repeatedly. When I was finally able to deal with a manager (again by email only) an individual named Cheryl repeated the previous statements of Doris affirming that the store said they sent 2 and, if i don't have any pictures of the original packaging, then they can't help me any further. I feel the way I've been treated by this organisation is disgusting and I don't know how they expect me to prove that I didn't receive a game. Surely the onus is on them to prove that they sent the game, however, they have declined to provide any evidence of this or even explain what checks were made.\\nI have been repeatedly made to feel like a liar who is trying to get a free game and clearly this company are much more inclined to believe their employees over paying customers.

I expect it will be moderated off their reviews site.\\nJust hope you never need to use the 2 year guarantee. My daughter bought one because I was under the impression that the company would honour the said guarantee but I was wrong. After about a year the computer failed to boot. I took it to our local store where they said they would check it over. A few days later I had a phone call telling me that the computer had liquid damage and a cracked battery fixing that the store manager said was not present at the time of sale because he checked the initial buy in inspection report. Unfortunately this information is not available to customers in the form of photographic evidence, I suspect that the shop who bought it in just did a tick box job and wiped the computer over and no such checks were ever carried out. I was fuming as I was unable to prove that any of what I was told was accurate and correct, all I can say is that I am aware that Macs have liquid indicators on the logic board and they can slowly change colour with mild humidity over a long period of time. I took the computer to an independent mac repair specialist and on opening it they found NO sign of liquid damage, and the plastic clip fracture which was securing the battery I was told was a common issue with the heat which is generated in this component and not someone poking about.\\nThe repairer tried changing some of the chips on the board but this still failed to resolve the issue. We settled for a replacement logic board at the cost of £180. The computer is now fine.\\nI was going to take the company through the small claims court but I was sick to the back teeth with their sharp unverifiable get out of warranty claims practice and didn't want to push up my blood pressure dealing with them.\\nLooking back I should have insisted that the computer be opened up in front of me and show me where this damage was and along with the so called buy in inspection report but these checks are done in the shops own time while you are out of the way.\\nThe Mac engineer that fixed it for me told me that he had tried to sell a laptop to CEX that he had stripped and cleaned and checked that it was all OK. When he went back to check for their buying offer price they told him that a USB port was physically damaged and that the computer was not worth much. He knew that the computer was in perfect condition when he gave it to them but couldn't prove it. Why would you expect to need to have photographic evidence. I'll leave to conclusions up to you but I know who I believe.\\nI hope you Macbook has a long and happy life but be VERY VERY AWARE if you have a problem with it and expect some sort of warranty redress.\\nHave a look at the comments on the Internet about this company, you will find many people experiencing the same sort of sharp practice as I received.\\nI for one will NEVER NEVER NEVER have anything to do with this company again\\nOn posting this reply I tried to use the nickname Mr Unhappy but the system said it was already used .... what can I say!!!\\n”\", '1', 'Posted 1 year ago']\n",

In this, the missing package issue was noted and a customer support executive emailed me. They wanted the copy of the reverse of the calling card which was sent to them on 29 January.

Anyway as I could proved they had damage it, I agreed to go ahead and purchase the S10 + 5G. I took the phone to EE and purchased a new sim, but for some reason they struggled to get the phone to recognise the sim and advised me to take the phone to a Samsung store as there appeared to be something wrong. Samsung checked the phone out on their system and apparently It was not showing where it was made and had other details that Samsung were concerned about. I went back to CEX and explained to them what Samsung had discovered and asked for a refund however despite this they refused to refund my money which I had paid them a few hours earlier. I again went back to Samsung to obtain further details of their concerns and we discovered that the phone had been imported from outside the EU and tethered to a Korean network which meant the 5G wouldn't work in this country anyway. After almost 7 hours, reluctantly CEX refunded my money but did not make any offer to compensate me for my time.

Though the service wasn't the quickest and the products weren't always the cleanest (had to scrub a few keyboards), by and large it was a good transaction.\\nRecently however, I ordered another batch of a few mice and a couple of keyboards, we have them spare in the office for when new people join or old ones break down. Unfortunately, when we tested them (not immediately) the two keyboards were faulty, one had a key that fell off on first press and the other had several keys that didn't respond to pressing at all. Btw, the keyboards were category A and B, so meant to be in pretty good shape.\\nI emailed CEX and they told me that we could take them into a local store, they would be tested and we would be refunded if there was an issue - here's the important bit, there was no mention of a timescale (the terms on their site mention a 24 month warranty). Returning keyboards being fairly low priority for a business, we didn't end up taking the keyboards in for several weeks.\\nTaking the keyboards into the store (again, no meniton that the delay was a problem) they said the keyboards would have to be tested. We didn't hear anything for a while so we got in touch to ask what was going on - it turns out that the keyboards were broken, there were signs of wear and tear, so they wouldn't be able to refund us.\\nI was obviously quite surprised by this because we knew they were faulty - that was why we had taken them back. The insinuation was clear, we had somehow broken the keyboards since we received them. When I suggested this was a little ridiculous (over email) the only response I have been given is that we should have taken them in sooner.\\nThere is no mention of how much sooner. There is, as far as I can see, nothing in their t&cs about an exact timeframe either. They say there's nothing they can do.\\nThe takeaway - if you want to buy something from CEX, make sure you go to the shop and test the product then and there. As far as I can tell the 24 month warranty is completely useless because they can always argue that you took to long to lodge a complaint or that the fault is your own fault.

I'm a photographer/videographer hobbyist and take real good care of my equipment. I even told them I wanted to trade as i wanted to purchase a Panasonic 4k camcorder they had online. I left without a sale and sold my Nikon online elsewhere. I contacted Cex online (customer services) explaned my case shown proof of my equipment and how I felt like they was trying to RIP me off and was issued a £10 evoucher as a sorry, I accepted that and was great full. I ordered the Panasonic 4k camcorder online as a Grade B, expecting it to be as my Nikon Grade B give or take the box you no. It arrived today it a terrible state, viewfinder was damaged, the wind proof microphone mesh was packed with mud like it had been dropped in mud, the rest of the body and charger looked like it had been sat on a dusty shelf for years. I took it to my local branch Leeds crossgates and asked the head man in there what condition he would sell it as to witch he replied 100% Grade C an asked what I payed for it as he was checking on his computer, I told him £335.00, and he then said its sorted I've issued you a full refund into your payment method, I never instructed or asked for a refund I simply asked him what Grade he would class it as, and how we could resolve it. I even asked him if he could of refunded the diference from Grade B to Grade C, his reply after changing something on the computerhe was on was we only Grade camcorders as Grade A or Grade B, clearly lieing about that as there are Grade C Camcorders on there site. I Shocked as to why he would even lie about it. He mentioned the DSLR I had wanted to sell and I told him I had contacted customer support and they said from pictures I sent they would have had no issues as to list my Nikon as a Grade A, to witch he replyed, I don't care what some customer service employee said sat over in India behind a desk without a clue what hes doing. I asked why the remark about India, and his reply was that's where the idiots are. I was shocked even a couple of other customers laughed in shock.

Purchases are typically delivered within two working days [occassionaly 1 working day, occassionally three working days]. Where I feel CEX could improve is that their listings do not contain enough information & some are really pretty slovenly. This can result in thinking you are buying one edition only to have another one delivered instead. I recently ordered a particular BD based on the picture and [scanty] item info. The item that turned up was the same film but a different edition to the one pictured in the listing. Although it is easy to return items to CEX & get a refund, if they took a little more time in describing items more acurately it would save their customer dissappointment and the trouble of queueing up to resolve the matter. That said, the prices I sometimes pay for specialist films are substantially below what I would pay other well-known sites. The other related problem is that when I returned the item in question to my local branch it reappeared on the CEX site as again available from the store, but still with the same misleading picture and description.

When I later spoke with her we then learnt that the amounts were different. When I emailed the complaints department to explain I was basically told that the £55 was the correct figure and that was final. Completely robbed and lied to. I know it’s only a difference of £22 but for what they got from me and the fact it was agreed the figure of £77, I was told shop was correct and I would not be getting my money and would no longer take my complaint.\\nDo not use this company as they just rob you.

Nothing was heard from them apart from the automatically generated email (stating delivery would take place between 3-5 working days) until Thursday. The email stated the item had been dispatched and gave me a UPS tracking number. The tracking number did not work at all and on Friday morning I contacted customer service by email about this issue. I also later contacted them by Facebook messenger as they hadn't responded to my email. It's not possible to phone CEX customer service, only email, Facebook & Twitter and they don't respond quickly to any of those either. I was then informed that the store hadn't shipped my item as reported and they would do so today (Friday). It would definitely go out today. I was given a new tracking number and using this I found that the item hadn't shipped on Friday. Saturday morning I contacted them again. After a long wait I was informed the item now wouldn't ship until Monday. No apologies. The item now won't arrive for a further 5 days, making the total shipping time 10 days! No apologies from anyone. I was just thanked for my understanding. I requested to pick up the item from the store but was told I could not for security reasons. Dont understand what security risks there are if i bring the appropriate ID. So I asked if I could cancel the order, get a refund of my in store voucher and buy one myself from another store. I was told this would take 3 working days to process! Now I am between a rock and a hard place as I have no quick solution to getting my voucher or my laptop. Customer service take ages to respond to communications and are unwilling to do anything quickly to resolve the situation. Contacting CS by electronic means is not acceptable.

They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.\\n”\",\n",

A week or so later, the first game arrived in a very thin parcel which definitely only contained 1 game as there would not have been room for any more. I did not think this was unusual, as their own website stated that games may be dispatched separately as they may come from different stores. However, after a few more weeks when the second game did not arrive, I chased it with CEX (something I was only able to do via their website/email as they have no customer service telephone number to speak of). Initially a handler named Doris responded very helpfully that she would chase this up with the store responsible for dispatching the games, however, the subsequent emails quickly turned accusatory with phrases like As you claim you haven't received one game and the store has confirmed that both the items were sent in the same parcel.\\nThe handler seemed fixated on the condition of the original packaging that the first game came in, which i confirmed i had since thrown away as i expected the 2nd game to follow separately but was in perfectly fine condition. The handler was also extremely reluctant to escalate this to a manager, instead attempting to pacify me by stating she would pass it to the central team to investigate repeatedly. When I was finally able to deal with a manager (again by email only) an individual named Cheryl repeated the previous statements of Doris affirming that the store said they sent 2 and, if i don't have any pictures of the original packaging, then they can't help me any further. I feel the way I've been treated by this organisation is disgusting and I don't know how they expect me to prove that I didn't receive a game. Surely the onus is on them to prove that they sent the game, however, they have declined to provide any evidence of this or even explain what checks were made.\\nI have been repeatedly made to feel like a liar who is trying to get a free game and clearly this company are much more inclined to believe their employees over paying customers. This company has made querying this issue, and complaining, as difficult as they possibly can and it has had a serious impact on my mental health.

Red flag one (have they damaged it?). Red flag two is you cannot contact CEX stores directly, it's pure autism but what it means is I spent TWO WEEKS going back and forth with a middle man, missing calls, etc.\\nThis made it very hard for me to help the team in London on what I'm assuming is an easy fix or a mistake (I hope so or they owe me alot of money).\\nThe final straw is, despite their policy online, they point blank refuse to return this item via post (there is no way given the circumstances I'm able to get back into a tier 4 London even if I pay for it)\\nSo essentially I have zero way of verifying these claims and zero way of getting my £500+ item back any time soon.\\nLet's suppose this minor issue WAS true ; they refuse to take the parts that DO work.. essentially what I would do is go in store, take it apart in front of them and sell the parts, which are all functional and essentially brand new.

Please note I'm not a layman or.l someone who can be taken for a ride; I build PCs for a living and it's incredibly frustrating that they are doing this pathetic computer says no moment which is probably no fault of their own, but another policy.\\nNow assuming this isn't the fault of the team in wood green (still a little suspicious) then the only issues lie with how CEX is run. The senior management needs to look into this and how communication between the customer and the teams are made and how products are handled and returned because this once great company is going to go down the pan if their not careful, the high street is dying and you cannot afford to have sh**t systems in 2020..\\nThe worst case scenario here is they have\\n1) damaged an expensive item of mine\\n2) refuse to communicate directly with me\\n3) refuse to post it to me\\n4) I can't get into London any time soon, maybe months,\\n5) if I do I risk my health\\n6) also refuse to simply take it apart and sell it assuming it was true (a 5 min job)\\nGiven this experience I would say avoid CEX and just go to local computer store.\\n”\",\n",

This is now in the complaints process, however the incompetence level is staggering, it is made worse by the fact I asked Customer services to 'double' check the repair (second time) before returning it. Which they assured me they had done. (Clearly not). The customer service team are adamant the unit is working and the store (same company by the way) have checked to evidence it is not working. I asked the matter to be referred as a customer complaint (but this was not done), I have re-initiated this as a complaint and the store and the repair centre are trying to work out if the unit is broken or not. (As a non-engineer) I have plugged it in and there is no on light to show it is on (my money is on it being broken). Cex responded to this saying it was being sorted (it wasn't) and I have had to liase between the shop and the repair team. An update Cex fans, the repair team claim it is fixed and returned it for the third time...you guessed it. Not working, shambles. I should point out that the third party repair company is Remedy Tech Centre Ltd. Final update, I purchased a new power lead at the Xbox worked. The Tech team returned it not work for a third time advising no repair possible. I have complained and now they have listed some (repairs) they claim so to justify taking my money. My compliant has been rejected. I only hope the Managing Director of CEX recognises the Customer service failings. This company are truly appalling.

I would assume this free courier back was an attempt to take some responsibility for their incompetence\\nI cannot recommend them for their store prices, and unfortunately can only recommend staying away from their Clinic repair service due to the risk of wasting your time and energy trying to deal with them.

I expect it will be moderated off their reviews site.\\nJust hope you never need to use the 2 year guarantee. My daughter bought one because I was under the impression that the company would honour the said guarantee but I was wrong. After about a year the computer failed to boot. I took it to our local store where they said they would check it over. A few days later I had a phone call telling me that the computer had liquid damage and a cracked battery fixing that the store manager said was not present at the time of sale because he checked the initial buy in inspection report. Unfortunately this information is not available to customers in the form of photographic evidence, I suspect that the shop who bought it in just did a tick box job and wiped the computer over and no such checks were ever carried out. I was fuming as I was unable to prove that any of what I was told was accurate and correct, all I can say is that I am aware that Macs have liquid indicators on the logic board and they can slowly change colour with mild humidity over a long period of time. I took the computer to an independent mac repair specialist and on opening it they found NO sign of liquid damage, and the plastic clip fracture which was securing the battery I was told was a common issue with the heat which is generated in this component and not someone poking about.\\nThe repairer tried changing some of the chips on the board but this still failed to resolve the issue. We settled for a replacement logic board at the cost of £180. The computer is now fine.\\nI was going to take the company through the small claims court but I was sick to the back teeth with their sharp unverifiable get out of warranty claims practice and didn't want to push up my blood pressure dealing with them.\\nLooking back I should have insisted that the computer be opened up in front of me and show me where this damage was and along with the so called buy in inspection report but these checks are done in the shops own time while you are out of the way.\\nThe Mac engineer that fixed it for me told me that he had tried to sell a laptop to CEX that he had stripped and cleaned and checked that it was all OK. When he went back to check for their buying offer price they told him that a USB port was physically damaged and that the computer was not worth much. He knew that the computer was in perfect condition when he gave it to them but couldn't prove it. Why would you expect to need to have photographic evidence. I'll leave to conclusions up to you but I know who I believe.\\nI hope you Macbook has a long and happy life but be VERY VERY AWARE if you have a problem with it and expect some sort of warranty redress.\\nHave a look at the comments on the Internet about this company, you will find many people experiencing the same sort of sharp practice as I received.\\nI for one will NEVER NEVER NEVER have anything to do with this company again\\nOn posting this reply I tried to use the nickname Mr Unhappy but the system said it was already used .... what can I say!!!\\n”\",\n",

The power turned on, aswell as the indicator light for the eject button and the sound of the fan. But the CD tray would not open, so I opened up the system and heard alot of rattling. A few random pieces fell out when I turned it upside down thinking it was a loose screw. But bits of plastic and a brittle piece of putty fell out. I instantly e-mailed CEX for an answer, refund or replacement. (i'd prefer a replacement as I've just bought 10 ps2 games to play) I heard a cookie cutter response and have been told to wait and wait and wait. All I did was purchase a console online and I received a useless lump of plastic and metal which is no good to anyone andpaid for it.\\nI wanted to see if they'd help out but it's been a couple of weeks with only the advice to wait for a response.

Took straight back to Cex all I wanted was a refund but as we paid in voucher as was talked into buying from them we couldn't have one even though I was told this was a gaming pc so I had no chose but to add another £220 towards another where I was told was a gaming pc this time but was coming from another shop and being delivered!

       "  \"“\\nI ordered an Apple accessory which was supposed to be delivered on 22 Jan. On 22 Jan courier left a calling card after a failed attempted to deliver per tracking. However per the same tracking, in 3 minutes time, the item had been marked delivered. Seeing this, I went home later and saw that a calling card had been left, but no sign of the package. Tracking chat on the courier website said that it would have been scanned wrongly. Next evening, I went to the courier depot only to be told that the package hadn't been returned to them and that they'd pass it on to senior management for investigation. Assuming that it might have been mistakenly not returned to the depot, and naively believing the chat, booked for a redelivery for the following Saturday through the courier website. Next day however, got a call from courier saying they still couldn't trace it.\\nSeller sent me a review request on trust pilot. In this, the missing package issue was noted and a customer support executive emailed me. They wanted the copy of the reverse of the calling card which was sent to them on 29 January. Then I was sent this email on 30 Jan. The customer support executive eventually, after a few back and forth emails, wrote back saying ...Based on the conclusion, they have stated that the package has been handed over to you by the courier team.\\nI am completely flummoxed by this reply from the seller and unsure what to do next. It appears that only sender can claim for insurance in the case of the type of delivery booked.\\nI had asked for further information on means to recourse but customer support wrote back repeating their last email saying it was delivered without providing clear information on how to escalate the issue.\\nSo having paid nearly £50, I am now left without the item, and a seller who won't acknowledge this, leaving me without any recourse to a refund/reclaim. Lesson learnt: Should have gone to apple store and bought it full price :(\\n”\",\n",

I tried my new I-pad in the case and found the plastic was slightly warped so didn't hold the I-pad securely ( held only 3 corners of the I-pad ) I could live with this, but when I tried to extend the back rest I noticed a large crack running the whole width of the case. I decided that I needed to return the as it was clearly faulty...... this is where it became frustrating, when I asked for a refund ( for which I was entitled ) I was told that this couldn't be processed as the fault may have been caused through the delivery company. I showed the supervisor the packaging ( which was not damaged at all ) to which he replied that this couldn't be ruled out still? Slightly baffled by his response I then showed him where the crack was ( it was clearly like it when it was posted out by the shop who had sent it ) as it is where it had been forced by incorrectly extending the rest. I was told that I now needed to contact customer services who would investigate? What would they do? Ask the shop who sent the goods if it was damaged in the first place? I have given up trying to get my money back and shall recommend that no-one I know uses this company again! I am an Manager and would give the customer the benefit of the doubt if was wasn't clear how the problem had occurred. This helps build a relationship with your brand, unfortunately on this occasion his actions now mean that I will no longer use this company.\\n”\",\n",

They advised they needed to test my phone and this would take 30 minutes. They took my phone and raised no concern about its condition, however on my return they advised my phone had a crack which I was very surprised about as I make a habit of looking after my phones. Anyway as I could proved they had damage it, I agreed to go ahead and purchase the S10 + 5G. I took the phone to EE and purchased a new sim, but for some reason they struggled to get the phone to recognise the sim and advised me to take the phone to a Samsung store as there appeared to be something wrong. Samsung checked the phone out on their system and apparently It was not showing where it was made and had other details that Samsung were concerned about. I went back to CEX and explained to them what Samsung had discovered and asked for a refund however despite this they refused to refund my money which I had paid them a few hours earlier. I again went back to Samsung to obtain further details of their concerns and we discovered that the phone had been imported from outside the EU and tethered to a Korean network which meant the 5G wouldn't work in this country anyway. After almost 7 hours, reluctantly CEX refunded my money but did not make any offer to compensate me for my time. So please be cautious if you purchase anything from CEX and what's more they will try and avoid respecting consumer rights. This experience was dreadful and has certainly made it more likely I will avoid using them in the future\\n”\",\n",

Though the service wasn't the quickest and the products weren't always the cleanest (had to scrub a few keyboards), by and large it was a good transaction.\\nRecently however, I ordered another batch of a few mice and a couple of keyboards, we have them spare in the office for when new people join or old ones break down. Unfortunately, when we tested them (not immediately) the two keyboards were faulty, one had a key that fell off on first press and the other had several keys that didn't respond to pressing at all. Btw, the keyboards were category A and B, so meant to be in pretty good shape.\\nI emailed CEX and they told me that we could take them into a local store, they would be tested and we would be refunded if there was an issue - here's the important bit, there was no mention of a timescale (the terms on their site mention a 24 month warranty). Returning keyboards being fairly low priority for a business, we didn't end up taking the keyboards in for several weeks.\\nTaking the keyboards into the store (again, no meniton that the delay was a problem) they said the keyboards would have to be tested. We didn't hear anything for a while so we got in touch to ask what was going on - it turns out that the keyboards were broken, there were signs of wear and tear, so they wouldn't be able to refund us.\\nI was obviously quite surprised by this because we knew they were faulty - that was why we had taken them back. The insinuation was clear, we had somehow broken the keyboards since we received them. When I suggested this was a little ridiculous (over email) the only response I have been given is that we should have taken them in sooner.\\nThere is no mention of how much sooner. There is, as far as I can see, nothing in their t&cs about an exact timeframe either. They say there's nothing they can do.\\nThe takeaway - if you want to buy something from CEX, make sure you go to the shop and test the product then and there. As far as I can tell the 24 month warranty is completely useless because they can always argue that you took to long to lodge a complaint or that the fault is your own fault. It's not impossible to get a good bargain from them but it comes with a lot of risk.\\n”\",\n",

I'm a photographer/videographer hobbyist and take real good care of my equipment. I even told them I wanted to trade as i wanted to purchase a Panasonic 4k camcorder they had online. I left without a sale and sold my Nikon online elsewhere. I contacted Cex online (customer services) explaned my case shown proof of my equipment and how I felt like they was trying to RIP me off and was issued a £10 evoucher as a sorry, I accepted that and was great full. I ordered the Panasonic 4k camcorder online as a Grade B, expecting it to be as my Nikon Grade B give or take the box you no. It arrived today it a terrible state, viewfinder was damaged, the wind proof microphone mesh was packed with mud like it had been dropped in mud, the rest of the body and charger looked like it had been sat on a dusty shelf for years. I took it to my local branch Leeds crossgates and asked the head man in there what condition he would sell it as to witch he replied 100% Grade C an asked what I payed for it as he was checking on his computer, I told him £335.00, and he then said its sorted I've issued you a full refund into your payment method, I never instructed or asked for a refund I simply asked him what Grade he would class it as, and how we could resolve it. I even asked him if he could of refunded the diference from Grade B to Grade C, his reply after changing something on the computerhe was on was we only Grade camcorders as Grade A or Grade B, clearly lieing about that as there are Grade C Camcorders on there site. I Shocked as to why he would even lie about it. He mentioned the DSLR I had wanted to sell and I told him I had contacted customer support and they said from pictures I sent they would have had no issues as to list my Nikon as a Grade A, to witch he replyed, I don't care what some customer service employee said sat over in India behind a desk without a clue what hes doing. I asked why the remark about India, and his reply was that's where the idiots are. I was shocked even a couple of other customers laughed in shock. I felt uncomfortable been spoke to like that about a product I had purchased, this whole experience as left me wanting to take it further. I'm now unable to purchase a camera to film this weekend motorsport as my money's on hold with PayPal. I would give this no stars if I could.

Purchases are typically delivered within two working days [occassionaly 1 working day, occassionally three working days]. Where I feel CEX could improve is that their listings do not contain enough information & some are really pretty slovenly. This can result in thinking you are buying one edition only to have another one delivered instead. I recently ordered a particular BD based on the picture and [scanty] item info. The item that turned up was the same film but a different edition to the one pictured in the listing. Although it is easy to return items to CEX & get a refund, if they took a little more time in describing items more acurately it would save their customer dissappointment and the trouble of queueing up to resolve the matter. That said, the prices I sometimes pay for specialist films are substantially below what I would pay other well-known sites. The other related problem is that when I returned the item in question to my local branch it reappeared on the CEX site as again available from the store, but still with the same misleading picture and description. Someone else is going to buy it and will most likely return it as I did. Overall the service I get from CEX online is excellent.\\n”\",\n",

Play station, dvds, ps3 games, Nintendo wii and games.. you get the gist. At the end I was told in total £73 for all, which was a bit disappointing, none the less decided to sell as was no use and didn’t want hassle of selling myself. At that point the staff member asked if I wanted to sell them the ps3 ( as they were only offering £19 for it less £15 as they said they would need to replace one of the remotes as it had a small crack in it) so basically £4 for a perfectly working ps3 console with working but small cracked remote! Anyway I said yes again so total was £77. They then said I would receive my money in a couple of days once they checked it was all working. Well after 4 days nothing so my parter went in to chase them up, at this point they put £55 onto her card, with my partner not knowing the amount they put on the card she left the shop. ( have to mention my partener didn’t know any of the discussions or monetary values for the items and she was just going in to ask when the balance would be paid). When I later spoke with her we then learnt that the amounts were different. When I emailed the complaints department to explain I was basically told that the £55 was the correct figure and that was final. Completely robbed and lied to. I know it’s only a difference of £22 but for what they got from me and the fact it was agreed the figure of £77, I was told shop was correct and I would not be getting my money and would no longer take my complaint.\\nDo not use this company as they just rob you. I certainly would never use them again and I will be making sure to be sharing my experience.\\n”',\n",

While the items do arrive in a timely manner on multiple occasions now I have received the wrong item, each time a far cheaper item has been sent. Upon returning one of the wrong items to the local store I was met with a bad attitude and told I would be required to wait 40 minutes while the item was tested. I found that highly amusing seen as it wasn’t even the correct item, I don’t see why there was any relevance in checking the item, working or not it wasn’t what I ordered. The attitude of the sales staff in the shop was less than welcoming (downright rude); I will never set foot in the Kilmarnock branch again as a consequence. After my first experience I was gifted a £10 voucher for my troubles. But alas yet again more incorrect items were sent. There appears to be no interest whatsoever in answering any queries in a timely manner. It’s a complete and utter joke that items cannot be checked prior to being shipped yet need to be thoroughly checked before they are refunded. I still await any form of response to this. Pay good money in good faith only to be sent incorrect items. If you enjoy the lottery then purchase an item from CEX online and you never know you may hit the jackpot and actually receive the correct item. If 0 stars was an option then this mob would be getting zero stars. The time and effort required for me to return the garbage they sent is not worth it so I effectively wasted my money.\\n”',\n",

The member of staff called 'Sean E' (taken from my receipt) actually snapped a piece of the casing when he was doing the checks and then had the audacity to tell me they wouldn't take it because it was broken, and denied breaking it after doing so infant of me! 'Sorry dude we're not taking that' I was absolutely fuming. After telling him to get his manager and explain the situation, he came back and told me they would rightfully be giving me the money - instead of apologising, he said nothing and I was on my way.\\nI also wanted to trade in my iPhone 6 which had a cracked screen and scuffing on the back, I was told to pay to get the screen replaced elsewhere and bring it back by one person, who said the scuffs weren't an issue as they were cosmetic. Then upon returning, they forgot to test it over the weekend - so I had to make 2 trips in one day back to the shop. When I got back (again) they then said they wouldn't take it because of the cosmetic scuffs??? Eventually after complaining for a while and to 3 or 4 different members of staff that were sent over to me, I got some money for it.\\nThe work done by these staff is absolute guess work, there are no guidelines at all in CEX. I was also given 3 different valuation prices for the phone by 3 different members of staff, one for every time I visited....\\nIt'll be music to their ears that I'm not coming back after the amount of complaining i've done, there definitely needs to be more training done at this shop, staff were so un-professional...

When i came back they said the warranty was void as there was a tiny crack in the rear external case of the phone. I explained that this has nothing to do with the Sim card not registering and then they showed me some bent pins where the sim card goes and said that i have bent the pins and that is why it doesn't work. I was furious as i had not bent the pins, I hadn't touched the sim card - why would I?

I had a verbal exchange with the manageress who instead of listening to reason stated that as she could not lose a signal despite trying 3 different sim cards that the phone was fine and became very aggressive and started swearing and offering me £60 in vouchers instead of £60 in cash which was how I originally paid.The phone was within the 30 day cash back policy and it was faulty so any reasonable person should and would have expected their cash back.What kind of business cannot diagnose a fault,tell you that they cannot diagnose a fault and still deny you your rights? I asked to speak to someone above this very angry young upstart but she point blank refused. I would advise that anyone thinking of buying a phone from this company to really think long and hard about doing it as you will probably end up with a phone that does not work properly and out of pocket !\\n”',\n",

       "  '“\\nA few days ago I was looking at webuy.com also known as Cex. I was very interested in a Lenovo A10 all in one computer as I did some research online about this item. I was very happy with the reviews on that computer that reading up on Cex webpage it said very clearly that this computer was graded as a B rating (which from previous purchases from Cex site I know for a fact that their rating system is top notch and second to non). My computer arrived a week later-I was not disappointed at all as there was not even a scratch on it, everything was just like it came off the production line. Yet the only thing which was not to my taste was the keyboard and mouse was a Dell product and not the correct Lenovo items for the computer?. Otherwise the computer was quite fast-a little slow on start up, everything else was first class-well done Cex you have not let me down yet. There is a problem in not being able to talk to the store as you are given just one number to dial? and this will not get you through to them, only in saying that if you want to get in touch with them then you are given an email address where you can email them with whatever your questions are. ( I think this is wrong as sometimes you want to know about a certain product and you want to know what state it is in before purchasing the item) Cex I would give you a 5 star ratting apart from this big problem that you have created for yourselves).\\n”',\n",

Brought it back to be rudely told they couldn’t do anything that I’d have to bring it to repair shop.did so and man in repair shop told me it was faulty and bring it back to cex and don’t let them fob you off. Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me.

I purchased a 3ds from the store in cramlington it was easy she got it out I selected a few games she put it in a box and went and got the charger put it in and i paid HAPPY !! Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.\n",

After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX).

Went back to the shop a day later bt would nt give me a refund coz theysaid therewasbt anythi g wrong with game even after i explai ed it wasnt what i was looking for. They gave me an in store voucher i stead bt that meant i cant use that money to buy game in another shop. My money is nw locked in their shop so nw i have no choice but come back to cex. Any other shop would have given a refund to card used when making the purchase. I do nt recommend buying from Cex.\n",

I came back to cex tallagh in Thursday in my only day off to get it fixed with no charging issue and girl told me that my pad is covered only 6 months as policy change during lockdown!!!! I ask for a manager and he said the same looking straight into my eyes!!!! When I went online for complain they told me that the pad IS covered by 2 years and I need to come back with a pad. Told them that I'm not going there as it's a waste of time and I dont drive so I was informed to send someone else or go to different cex in Ireland!!! Becaaue of your fault I need to involve 3rd people into this or go to city centre!!!! Its a joke!!!! Its already week that my issue is not sorted and I'm week without a pad. Lady in customer service keep telling me that I have to go to bring the old pad as otherwise i dont get new one. Really??? Pad cost you about 30 euro and your sales person lie to me about it. They offer me 10 euro to cover my time waste..... 10 euro... that's what a customer is worth for them. I just ask to ship new pad to my home as I already spend nearly 2 hours walking to them and they lie to me by telling shorter period of warranty even talking with manager. Be aware of this company as everything what they are telling could be a lie and small things like pad replacement it's a nightmare for them.

Brought it back to be rudely told they couldn’t do anything that I’d have to bring it to repair shop.did so and man in repair shop told me it was faulty and bring it back to cex and don’t let them fob you off. Went back to cex to be fobbed off. Only by another person who spoke to me like I was a two year old. Again never looked at phone only have me same speech the last lad did. It’s like there trained to do tell the same thing to all. Was absolutely disgusted. These are young people trained to lie. They have not heard the last from me. This shop needs highlighting and should not be allowed rip people off like they do. I say shut them down.\\n”“\\nOnly I can’t give it a zero review I bloody well would!!!! I bought a phone in my local CEX store on the 2/12/21 the phone hadnt been working from I got it the speaker was not working right probably down to the fact the day I got it the lad serving me dropped it on the counter so I took back today they told me to leave with them for 40 mins to check it over then I go back in only to be told £72 voucher exchange or £57 cash absolute bloody joke I paid £155 for the phone so I’m out £98 and I cannot afford to buy a new phone now until way after Xmas stay clear of this shop if you don’t want robbed or fobbed off!!!!!!!!\\n”“\\nI have given them a 1 star but they deserve a minus 10 never in my life have i ever recieved such service such utter twaddle in my life ! 43 years on this earth and I thought I had heard it all . I purchased a 3ds from the store in cramlington it was easy she got it out I selected a few games she put it in a box and went and got the charger put it in and i paid HAPPY !! Untill I got home the charger was the wrong size and didn't fit I thought easy mistake I'll go back tomorrow and get it swapped by the way £165 I spent !! So I went back explained what had happened thinking they would swap the charger that would be the end no . Why have u got the charger u don't get that u don't buy a device from here and be supplied with a charger not even a wire that's not our policy that's not Nintendo's policy . Nintendo apparently don't supply any means of making the device u have bought work !!! I do not believe this I have previously owned 3 other 3ds s and always had a wire supplied !! They made me feel ridiculous next thing was well u can have a refund but u will have to leave it with us for 1 hr 30 so we can run a diagnostic s check as it's left the store I bought this yesterday st 430 it's now 930 the next day and I haven't got a lead to charge it .. then it will take 3-5 days for the refund our staff member should not have given u a charger !! I asked her about the box leads and warranty she said all included TRAIN YOUR STAFF !!! I feel utterly ridiculous ,spoken to like I'm an idiot and totally disgusted by your staff manner ,customer service and the way they laughed when i left the shop !!! Never ever shop here they take your money laugh at u and make up stupid rules . This ds was bought as a replacement for a disabled mans Christmas present i hope you are ashamed and laughing at that to.\\n”“\\nI have bought a second hand I phone with giving my old phone and added the difference, the stuff was a bit overwhelmed so It took me ages to verify everything and log out to my account ... but the phone still work and it is in a good condition for a good price\\n”“\\nZoie and Kieran at cex in Milton Keynes made such an effect for me and served me with a smile and patience, I was selling my Xbox series x and they went above and beyond to attend to my needs, bank transfer wasn't good for me and there wasn't much money left in their tills, they still went and checked all the tills to collect the money I needed.\\nwill defiantly recommend this store, great customer service.\\n”“\\nI sold in two iPhones because I’m struggling for money, they claimed that the phones where damaged, I had photos of the phones before shipping them to CeX. CeX sent the phones back to me damaged, I made a complaint and they filed a claim with Royal Mail and told me I had to wait 30 days (CeX paid postage so they were legally responsible for what happened to my goods) so I waited and then I get this short email back basically saying they had an outcome with Royal Mail (which means they got paid compensation for my iPhone which they already shipped back to me) instead of giving me the compensation they told me that they will buy the damage phone, so they pocket the compensation of £85 and give me £34.99 so they are pocketing the compensation, trying to give me less and will get the phone fixed and sell it. They are very dishonest and try to scam disabled people like me\\n”“\\nA 3 star purely on the amount if dirt and yellow stains in every game I have bought, covered in stickers as well, why can't you clean your games ?\\n”“\\nReally bad place to shop, the phone I bought became faulty after 8 days and they claimed the fault was caused by me. They have been extremely rude and did not check the phone at all. They offer you guarantee but they will find every excuse not to honor this guarantee. And don't try even to take it with customer service as there is almost non. You can't phone or email them, only fill some online form which does not help as the person who replies is taking immediately the side of the shop without providing any kind of proof to the claims made by the Cex shop manager.\\nStay away they don't deserve even the one star, If I could give zero stars I would but unfortunately one star is the lowest grade\\n”“\\nTook laptop in last Wednesday did not receive cash. Went back in to the shop as could not contact by phone, they had not uploaded my bank details said they had done it now it is Monday afternoon still not received payment left 2 emails asking them to call me no one has called me still appalling service\\n”“\\nSold my mobile at cex. very fair with the price offered.

They come back with “sorry it didn’t leave us like it. We cannot help any more”.\\nUnbelievably poor. Steer clear.\\n”“\\nJust never recieved my order. Contacted them about it, it was delivered to a post office miles from me and I was told to collect it and its tough. You have to pay for delivery too, so just dont use them.\\n”“\\nThey have very very bad customer service. They sell faulty goods and state that their warranty does not cover 'customer damage' when in fact the goods they sell are already faulty.\\nbought some ear pods 27 September 2021 for £60. took them back 3 weeks later and told them left ear bud not working. They did their 'diagnostic' which lasted 10 minutes. They then told me it is working fine. Continued to have problems and took them back (twice within 2 months of purchase).\\nThey then tell me pin is damaged and that their warranty does not cover customer damage. I told them that I hardly used the buds. They were not interested!!!!!\\nnever buy anything from these crooks. Spoke to someone who worked for them. He said they buy items off of people and just put them on display without checking properly.\\n”“\\nOnly they want is your money nothing else\\n”“\\nSo called warranty was voided because screw was missing when they checked it But it was there when it was securely posted Won’t be using this company again\\n”“\\nGreedy!!\\nThey had a dvd of me for 90p and sell for £6\\n”“\\nDvd s price they give u about 1 penny\\n”“\\nNo after service will not be going to cex shop again samsung a70\\n”“\\nI sold goods to get instore credit in a voucher, the voucher dosent work online?

This should be a 2 minute phone call, not this ridiculousness\\n”“\\nWorkers are useless haven't got a clue and con you got a silly girl who took the Wii console and said she couldn't take the controller gave a receipt to get the money but when I went back was told they couldn't take it as there's no controllers maybe get workers who know what they are doing and talking about. Absolutely shocking workforce\\n”“\\ndid not deliver item and still waiting 2 weeks later and they send this\\nOn 2 Nov 2021, at 10:28, CeX wrote:\\nHi Simon,\\n\\nThank you for your patience.\\n\\nI have checked with the store and it seems that due to some mixup the AMD Radeon RX 580 was sent to an incorrect address and the other customer's order was sent to your address.

Bought a Samsung tablet in May 2021 with a 24month warrenty, 5months after buying it the screen has got lines on it, taken it back to the Portsmouth branch where we bought it, to be told it has been dropped, we have not dropped it and looking on you tube it is a common problem that a wire has come loose, but have been told we have to pay £60 to get it repaired.\\nNot only have we been called liars but we have to pay to get it repaired. Totally disguised with the customer service, and the warrenty isn't worth the paper it is printed on.\\n”“\\nSo I brought a mac book air from cex it had taken me just under 8 months to save up for a second hand laptop. I have had the laptop for less then 4 months and now it has a charging fault. I took it back and now they are saying it damaged. I am so disappointed.i have used my laptop about 4 times over the sapce of 4 months and its always kept save and locked away where no one has acess. I had brought the laptop with some damages on it I am so stupid I should of taken pictures on arrival. I am trying me best to get this resolved I just can't afford to loose £300 it's left me so heartbroken and I just can't believe it. What's the worst thing I always go to this cex for my kids games and just browse and I always say hello to all staff.\\n”“\\nDO NOT buy pokemon gameboy games from this company. Two i've had have been fake & three have had no batteries in them. The store where i bought them wouldn't even replace a dead/dry battery but are happy enough to sell you it when you can't save your game. What do they actually test?? AVOID AT ALL COSTS!!\\n”“\\nTook my Fitbit versa in to sell to them- really great condition and they offered me £27.....fair enough so left it there to be tested came back after an hour to be told it was reported lost/ stolen.....U have a receipt from Amazon for it - bought it new in December 2019 so what the hell? I resent being labelled a thief especially in CEX which clearly does buy stuff from dodgy people! I have complained to Head Office and am now selling it elsewhere on line. Waste of time dealing with them.\\n”“\\nPray on the desperate and sell xbox series x for 200 quid more than an original.\\nProfiteering and should be illegal what they do.\\nTerrible company, with equally terrible moral trading standards.\\nDon't touch with a barge pole. Also known to fence stolen goods, which shoplifters steal and takenand sell to them.\\nAvoid like the plague. Zero stars.\\n”“\\nThey knowingly sent out a charger that did not fit the watch. Refused any partial refund for the wrong charger.\\nKept the watch because I have a charger.\\nUnimpressed.\\n”“\\nThere incompetent 5 times I've ordered dvds online and came back saying they weren't in stock but 10 days later my money wasn't refunded its a scam\\n”“\\nAbsolutely outrageous. My 7 year old daughter change her mind about 2 xbox360 games (£14) we have purchased. She has not even played them.\\nCame to store 4 days later to get a full refund obviously. Guess what?

I felt like I am trying to return out of date smelly fish!\\nI've been offered £5 for both games, because they CAN BUY IT from me!\\nI've never felt so ripped-off in my life.\\n”“\\nPurchased a Nintendo DS for my partner from CEX in KILMARNOCK, after playing she complained that there was a part missing and it wasn’t charging properly. Having only bought it the previous day took it back to the shop with receipt for my money back only to discover that it MUST be put through a “warranty test” to justify my return. After 20 mins or so the staff member assured me the device was okay as he had been “playing it” non stop since i dropped it in ( that’s some extensive warranty test!”) Anyway, with these red flags now raised in my mind i thought it was best that i declined the device and requested my money back. I was utterly outraged when they told me we can’t return you’re money as it’s only an instore voucher we can provide, i thought the bloody cheek, first sell me an item that doesn’t work properly then refuse to hand me back the cash i paid for it eventhough i returned the item within the two day window (confirmed time limit from a member of staff in the IRVINE CEX). I wouldn’t recommend this mob as they falsely advertise their warranty and aren’t willing to budge even with the phrase “the customers always right”. AVOID like the plague of zombies that pollute Kilmarnock burns mall. These jokers are rip off merchants.\\n”“\\nBought a used laptop from Crystal Peaks Sheffield. The 2 year warranty was attractive and I mistakenly trusted they would be decent and honest to deal with. It failed after a few months but CEX would not honour the guarantee. I accept the laptop was bought as 2nd class because of previous owner mishandling but if CEX want to play that game ,don't pretend it has a warranty. Very disappointed with CEX and would advise against using them.\\n”“\\nBrought a iPhone SE within a week the screen developed a fault and then went off completely. Took back into store and said about it asked for instore voucher so I could get a replacement and they came back saying I have damaged the scree it’s not covered on the 24 month warranty as it’s classed as accidental damage.. so wasted £360 and a useless phone and CEX staff it’s my fault and should be more careful.\\nCEX warranty is a complete joke and staff are rude.\\n”“\\nPlease do not buy from cex. I went to get a Xbox one controller to find out it's cheaper to buy them brand new. When to return the item to be told i camt have my no at back only in store credit. RIP OFF\\n”“\\nCex pay next to nothing for games etc, sold a few to them then had 2 returned to me with no explanation, no email, nothing. Our exchange came to £2.83 instead of the £6.86. Avoid and sell privately....\\n”“\\nAvoid avoid avoid.\\nI bought a game off their Tallaght shop (dublin ireland). The game just wasnt the right edition iwas looking for. Only figured when i got home. Went back to the shop a day later bt would nt give me a refund coz theysaid therewasbt anythi g wrong with game even after i explai ed it wasnt what i was looking for. They gave me an in store voucher i stead bt that meant i cant use that money to buy game in another shop. My money is nw locked in their shop so nw i have no choice but come back to cex. Any other shop would have given a refund to card used when making the purchase. I do nt recommend buying from Cex.\\n”“\\nDo not buy from cex..pay a few pound more for new\\nX box controller under warranty...4 times same fault..they refused to repair again..even though previous repairs free of charge..incompetent engineers..cheap parts badly fitted\\n”“\\nAbsolute clowns tried offer me £15 for a WORKING PS4 console - because the serial number off the CONTROLLER had peeled off... I laughed and walked out the shop. Plus no matter what price offered they will deduct 5 pounds for no reason whatsoever. I WILL NEVER USE CEX AGAIN.\\n”“\\nSold a lancehead quarts mouse today for £10 it is worth alot more than that id say atleast £70 I also had a keyboard with me a v2 chromatic Black widow quarts offered 60 for all I said absolutely not\\n”“\\nNot sure about all the bad reviews on here, never had any issues with my local store and any issues i've run into online (had a couple, been sent the wrong google nest/home model, dirty items) have been quickly dealt with. I suggest contacting CEX through facebook messenger, usually get a reply the same day. Been refunded for items in full quickly and easy when faults have arose, sold to cex in store too and had no issues again.\\n”“\\nFrankly I am fed-up with getting damaged DVD's from CEX. Angry with myself just bought another box set, needless to say it's badly damaged. Clearly there quality control is simply just poor.\\nAs for their customer service I concur with other reviewers the best adjective is: terrible. That said I notice they monitor sites like this to leave a: just contact us; let us help: really!\\nI am attempting to cancel a DVD box set I ordered, once done will be terminating my account. Amazon is where I will buy from.\\nSo angry with myself for buying from them again.\\nBuy DVD/DVD box set; settle down to watch. The the endless frustration of a damaged DVD. Well this was the last time.\\n”“\\nOrdered a laptop from them 20th July 2021. Item was never delivered. I was refused a refund and made to wait until 3rd August as they could not be bothered to chase the order with Royal Mail.\\nIt is now 3rd August, still no laptop, no update, no response to email and no refund.\\nThis company is genuinely not worth dealing with. Customer service is very very poor. There are other sites selling similar products that I will be going to now.\\nUpdate 4th August 2021.\\nAfter contact from CeX this morning (after this review, no surpise!) they still clearly have not looked into the countless emails I have sent over the last two weeks. Still no meaningful response, no refund and no accountability for their error as they are trying to blame Royal Mail who they subcontract out to so ultimately the responsibility lies with CeX.\\n”“\\nI purchased a limited collectors edition box set on Blu-ray which was in a steelbook “breaking bad” what they send me was the regular edition. The limited edition they charged me £22 for, they sent me the £15 regular edition and rather than refund me the difference they insisted I travel an hour away to the post office to return it which would cost me more in travel costs than it’s worth. They don’t care how they treat customers.\\n”“\\nAvoid, avoid, avoid. Customer service is simply pathetic in this place. I bought ps4 not long time ago and I asked person who sold me it (Killian) 3 TIMES!!!! is the 24 warranty cover everything including controller. He said yes 3 times. I came back to cex tallagh in Thursday in my only day off to get it fixed with no charging issue and girl told me that my pad is covered only 6 months as policy change during lockdown!!!! I ask for a manager and he said the same looking straight into my eyes!!!! When I went online for complain they told me that the pad IS covered by 2 years and I need to come back with a pad. Told them that I'm not going there as it's a waste of time and I dont drive so I was informed to send someone else or go to different cex in Ireland!!! Becaaue of your fault I need to involve 3rd people into this or go to city centre!!!! Its a joke!!!! Its already week that my issue is not sorted and I'm week without a pad. Lady in customer service keep telling me that I have to go to bring the old pad as otherwise i dont get new one. Really??? Pad cost you about 30 euro and your sales person lie to me about it. They offer me 10 euro to cover my time waste..... 10 euro... that's what a customer is worth for them. I just ask to ship new pad to my home as I already spend nearly 2 hours walking to them and they lie to me by telling shorter period of warranty even talking with manager. Be aware of this company as everything what they are telling could be a lie and small things like pad replacement it's a nightmare for them. I had to contact my solicitor as I can not leave it like that right now.\\n”“\\nRip off merchants. Took my iPhone 11 in to attempt to sell in Worcester . In good condition they looked it over and said it’s a C Grade!! Offered me £110. I told them to shove it. When I took it into apple they said it’s a B grade . They gave me £400 for it towards a new phone. I’ll never sell here again or buy anything CEX membership has now been thrown a way in the trash just like your stores . Sell your items privately don’t use CEX their robbing you of your money\\n”“\\nTerrible customer service resulted in my account being banned which I'm glad for do cex treat all their customers like #@£!.\\n”“\\nBEWARE IF BUYING A LAPTOP!!\\nQ: When is a laptop sealed battery not a sealed battery? A: When you try to get it repaired under the CeX warranty.\\nHad laptop for 8 months, hardly used yet battery is completely dead. Checked CeX warranty and despite it clearly stating it covers sealed batteries, the staff in Edinburgh's Rose Street branch say differently because it can be unclipped and is therefore a consumable! Absolute disgrace, bunch of con artists, well done on losing any future custom from us The warranty isn't worth the paper it's printed on AVOID, AVOID, AVOID!!\\n”“\\nI ordered an Ipad from here. Cex has sent me a completely different Ipad that is not part of the company. When I went the the Cex store for a refund they said I received the wrong Ipad and didn't help me at all to get a refund despite Cex sending me the wrong one, the staff are horrible. None of the staff helped me with anything even though they made this mistake. Never had such a bad experience before. Will never buy from here again, terrible staff. Store manager is horrible as well and didn't try to help me at all. I contacted customer service but they kept saying that they didn't send me the wrong Ipad despite me having proof that I received a different Ipad from the one I ordered. I do not recommend anyone to buy from here, they are a scam.\\n”“\\nFobbed off with excuses, refused to replace a faulty battery on my daughters mobile phone under the 24 month warranty, and at the Uxbridge branch lost the sim card to the phone and humiliated my wife and daughter in front of other customers.\\n”“\\nI bought a smart watch to cex and I newore it once they checked it over and said it was a grade a when I went to collect my cash they tried to say that it was scratched but when they checked it there was no scratches on it I felt like I was being coned. and the member of staff had a bad attitude I was very disappointed\\n”“\\ntook my nikon camera for valuation.it was about 15 years old bought from argos.to my disgust it flagged up as stolen, i even still have the reciept and original nikon box..never going there again , it doesnt make any sense that shop.\\n”“\\nTracking number CH006536494IE\\nWebuy order. Posted a previous order 2 weeks ago, paid for postage myself and received no problem. Posted this order 470497 on the 06/06/21 using their label and its stuck in a loop going back and fort form D12 to D11 and back D12 all week. An post informed me that Cex are sending it back to their po box, explains why it's constantly in a loop. After the ten days are up order will be cancelled. Someone at Cex in Dublin 11 wants a playstation 4 console with all accessories including 5 games for free. Be aware of the free postage label!!!!\\n”“\\nBought airpods for €135 came covered in ear wax absolutely vile\\n”“\\nI've been saving up vouchers for Christmas presents only to be told my vouchers have been redeemed. I've not bought anything. No help or information on who used my voucher. Total scam.\\n”“\\nPurchased an iPhone online about 10 months ago and speakers have suddenly gone. As it had 2 year guarantee I took it back to my local town store Nottingham exchange walk, expected to have a battle as you do with any faulty goods these days but was pleasantly suprised. They tested the phone found the fault and refunded me - still waiting for the payment to clear as was done on a Sunday but the staff were all helpful and polite nothing was an issue and they didn't have a problem checking out what I'd said. So Happy with the service i purchased another phone at the same time whilst waiting for the money to clear! I would recommend and id certainly buy from them again, got the service I always wished every one gave! Thank you!\\n”“\\nI bought some Powerbeats in May (Grade B). came in a filthy box and were broken. I couldn’t take back to the store for 2 week due to work but made them aware as soon as the product arrived. I had to travel to a store to return the item and pick up a replacement which had been arranged following my initial Trust Pilot review.\\nI took them back to the store who could see that they clearly shouldn’t have been dispatched in the condition they were in. The store manager showed me the replacement and embarrassingly informed me the replacement was damaged as well. I was fuming and had no option for a refund.\\nI made a complaint and Kester was liasing with me. He offered a good will gesture of £10. He then asked me to change my initial review!!!! I didn’t of course and then once the money had been refunded I look to but the Powerbeats again only to see they had increased the price for the same Grade by at least £10. This meant that the £10 voucher was basically non existent! I complained about this and was told I should have purchased the other Powerbeats immediately!!\\nI replied stating I did and the replacement you ordered for me to collect in the store was again faulty so I left it 2 weeks before deciding to try again!!\\nDon’t bother buying anything as if everything is correct CeX are great but appalling when things go wrong. The customer service has been none existent. You can’t even speak to anyone and have to do everything by email!\\n”“\\nDo not order from this company online. They take payment and only let you know that the item is not in stock if you contact them first. Your refund might be returned eventually if you are lucky. Whatever about the stores, save yourself alot of hassle and try another company online. Personally I would give minus stars as a review.\\n”\""
